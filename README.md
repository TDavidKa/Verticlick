# Verticlick
### The Mousse of The Future :)

## What This Is

The average computer mouse as we know it was a solution to an important need in computing. It is an impressive landmark of
computer development, allowing for even more interactivity between users and their devices. However, it is not the perfect
hardware device- it is a source of repetitive stress on our wrists, which can cause issues such as carpal tunnel and radial
wrist pain. In response, alternatives such as trackpads and ergonomic mice were developed, to allow users to have a more
natural resting position for their hand while using a computer. Track pads do help with repetitive stress by replacing wrist 
movement with finger movement, but they lose out on accuracy and functionality. On the other hand, while ergonomic mice are 
still new, and often advertised as an office device, they give back that accuracy while solving the traditional wrist pain 
problems. The main problem is that they are not extended for groups such as gamers or developers who often require a numpad for 
productivity on the side of their mouse.

As a response, our team has produced Verticlick, an advanced ergonomic mouse with additional features. Similar to ‘mmo’ or 
‘gaming’ mice, we have added a numpad to the side of our ergonomic mouse, to appeal to those aforementioned groups. Both 
ergonomic and traditional mice have pros and cons, such as the pros of functionality versus the cons of wrist stress in the 
traditional mouse. With our product, we aim to combine the pros of both, while alleviating their cons. We would like to 
evaluate the mouse’s success in two ways: Ease of switching to this mouse over the traditional mouse, and reduction of 
repetitive movements.
